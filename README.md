### My name is Ross.
### I am an aspiring developer.

I am working on making clones of apps to figure out how they work, and then using those clones to get ideas to create my own apps. 
For example: 
- I completed a simple iMDB clone using the TMDB API.
- I completed a Cruise r Nah app that tells you if a movie title is a movie that Tom Cruise was a part of.
- I completed an eCommerce app.

I am also looking for small JavaScript projects or challenges to further develop my problem-solving skills.
If you have any ideas or links, please let me know!

Fun facts: 
- I've never been married, but I have had a kidney stone. 
- I am a recovering cinephile, but still love movies!
- I play Nintendo Switch.
